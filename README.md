# Coronary Artery Disease Prediction using Ensemble Machine Learning

## Overview
The primary aim of this study is to **develop and evaluate an ensemble-based machine learning model** for the accurate prediction of **coronary artery disease (CAD)** using clinical and demographic data.  

This work places particular emphasis on **applicability within the healthcare context**, where early detection and effective risk stratification can significantly improve patient outcomes.  

## Objectives
- Enhance **early detection** of CAD.  
- Improve **risk stratification** in clinical settings.  
- Combine the predictive strengths of three machine learning algorithms:  
  - **Random Forest (RF)**  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  - **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**  

## Approach
The study employs an **ensemble learning framework**, integrating the outputs of the three models to achieve higher accuracy, robustness, and clinical relevance than any single model could provide.  

## Application
This ensemble model is intended for deployment in a **decision support system (DSS)** to assist healthcare practitioners in Nigeria with timely and reliable CAD diagnosis.
